# 🔥 Story Weaver

*Where tales come alive, one sentence at a time*

## Overview

Story Weaver is a cozy, collaborative story writing platform designed for creative teams, writers, and hobbyists. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this web app allows multiple users to contribute to a story one sentence at a time. Each user only sees the most recent part of the story and can add their own line to continue the narrative.

## Features

- **Collaborative Writing:** Add your sentence to the story and help shape its direction.
- **Editable Contributions:** Users can edit the sentences they wrote for smoother flow and corrections.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Warm orange and black palette creates a relaxing, inviting atmosphere.
- **Session-Based Identity:** Optionally enter your name before contributing.
- **Story Timeline:** View the full history of all contributions.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile.
